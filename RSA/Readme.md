<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a "demonstration" of the RSA public/private key encryption algorithm</p>
<p>It is in no way usable, but rather a practical way of showing you how the algorithm works</p>

<p>It decrypts letter by letter and is really really slow. It is all done in software and as Python is</p>
<p>notoriously slow in it self compared to compiled languages, this is a very bad implementation of the RSA encryption</p>

<p>Also, it only uses 3 digit prime numbers (again, any higher and you would be sitting there all day long)</p>
<p>However, it can be viewed and interpreted for learning purposes</p>


<p>Anyways, I hope you learn something from it</p>
<p>Here is a great video demonstration of the algorithm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zahvcJ9glg</p>
