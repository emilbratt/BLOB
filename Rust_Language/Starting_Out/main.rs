fn main() {
    // I`ve been wanting to learn a new lanaugage
    // and the languages I`ve thought about
    // are C, C# and Rust

    // Viability, Productivity, Capabilities and Efficiency
    // have been the main reason for the "why"

    // After some back and forth comparing
    // this vs. that, "googling the why"
    //  and consulting people with with years
    // of programming/devops experience,
    // I`ve finally settled on Rust


    // So why Rust?

    // I`ve spoken to developers in both the software
    // and devops field that have years of experience
    // in programming with C and similar languages

    // What they all seem to agree on is that Rust is
    // one of the (if not the) best language when
    // it comes to its viability, execution-speed,
    // language growth potential (Rust is fairly new)
    // and the way Rust handles memory

    // Looking at what experienced programmers say
    // regarding the things Rust does exceptionally well:
    //   -preventing segmentation faults,
    //   -providing high level of safety for multi-threaded code,
    //   -being as productive as Python while as efficient as C

    // Another reason is that Rust is compiled directly
    // to machine code, unlike C# which is compiled to
    // bytecode and dependes on a runtime-environment

    // These reasons as I understand it makes Rust
    // a good choice if you want your applications
    // to run on all major platforms like desktop,
    // servers, handhields, cloud-infrastructures
    // as well as micro controllers like arduino

    // Cool, let`s throw in my very first
    // line of code inside this main function..
     println!("Hello Rust!");
