I did solve this task, however..
This could be solved much easier.

Instead of using a while loop to iterate through all the items
I could`ve used the "%" operator to calculate the remainder thus jumping straight
to the correct item.
Just after deliver, I spoke with Knut (another student) who also completed IBE 151
and he tought me this which I didn`t realize until he showed me his answer.
