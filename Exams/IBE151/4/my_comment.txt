On this task, as on the first task; I messed up a small detail.
I was supposed to pass the filename as a parameter in the function.
Next time I will have to read the exercise more carefully.

I did however solve this task with as few methods as possible.
No split() and no strip().
The longest word is found by using the len() function and assigning the word with
the greatest length to a variable and returning it.
