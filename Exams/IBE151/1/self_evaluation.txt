The task was to write a program that takes an input and converts it from miles to meter



I did not pay enough attention to the question in part where I was suppose to
add a printed text.
The program should have asked by printing out:
Enter the distance in miles
and the result should have contained:
The distance in meters is: <answer>

Overall, the math part was solved correctly and I moved on a bit too quick.
