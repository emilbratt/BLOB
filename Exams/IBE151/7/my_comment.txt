The last task given was also the only task where we had to prove
that we understand sorting and how to implement this.
It specifically tells that we are not allowed to use any of pythons sorting functions.

The task askes us to sort a dataset of tuples inside a list.

Fortunately I have been doing alot of database queries and I am used to
working with nested lists/tuples.

The important thing to notice here, that can make or break this problem is that
we have to compare an element that resides inside a tuple which in turn resides
inside the list.
Depending on outcome of comparizon, we take action (or not action)
for the whole tuple (magpie and size) that is inside the list.


In the sorting algorythm I used only the operator > and not >= because if the
the magpie was the same size as one already in the list, it will be ignored
remained placed after that magpie because it is compared after the one before.
