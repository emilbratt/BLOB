This was a tough one. Had to come back to this one a couple of times.

After analyzing the task I did realize that I only had to concider these rows:
# queen can always take on chessBoard[0][0] and on chessBoard[-1][-1]
# queen can reach first square and last square on row 1
# queen can reach 2nd position and 2nd last position on row 2
# queen can reach 3nd position and 3rd last position on row 3
# and so on.......

After imagining these in my head, I was able to transfer this to code.
Watching how other students solved this I also realized that I could solve this
in many fewer lines.
For example: I did not have to create a virtual chessboard using lists, but I think it
shows the idea I had in my head.
I still think that my solution is alot easier for the
human brain to interpret as I am a fan of "self-explaining code".

Though.. In production, I would refrain from writing unecessary lines.
